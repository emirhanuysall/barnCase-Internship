# BarnCase: Barn Management Application

FarmProject is a simulation-based application designed to manage a farm with cows, sheep, and chickens. Each animal produces specific products (milk, wool, eggs) at different intervals and under specific conditions. The project focuses on managing these animals, monitoring their production, and calculating the revenue generated from the sale of their products. The application is built using C# and WinForms, following a multi-layered architecture.
